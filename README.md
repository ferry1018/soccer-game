This Python code implements a text-based simulation of a Soccer World Cup penalty shootout scenario. 
In the game, the player faces a crucial decision: whether to take the penalty kick themselves or pass it to a teammate. 
The outcome of each choice is determined randomly, with possibilities for both scoring and missing for both the player and the teammate. 
Depending on the outcome, different narrative paths unfold, resulting in either victory or defeat for the player's country. After each game, the player is given the option to play again. 
The code structure includes functions for printing messages with pauses, handling the player's choices, and managing the game's flow.
